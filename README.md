# Modular Laravel

This is the source code for the [Modular Laravel](https://laracasts.com/series/modular-laravel) Laracasts course.   
Please keep in mind **this is not a complete application** and it is not production ready.   

I suggest you to use this code as a reference for the course and try not to treat it as a recipe. As we've discussed in the course, every application is different and your needs might differ. 

You can follow [the commit history](https://github.com/mateusjatenee/modularization/commits/main/) to see the changes made in each lesson.
